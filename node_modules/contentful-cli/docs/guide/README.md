# Contentful CLI - `guide` command

A guide introducing basic concepts for working with Contentful.

## What steps does the guide contain?

### 1. Sign in to a new or existing account

A shortcut to [contentful login](../login) to log the user in or offer a sign up
form. This step will be skipped when already logged in.

### 2. Create a Space to hold your content

A shortcut to [contentful space create](../space/create) to create a new space.

### 3. Create first content model and entries

A shortcut to [contentful space seed](../space/seed) to set up a content model
and add the first Content entries to the freshly created space.

#### 4. Download app to display your content

Download one of the [boilerplate example projects from Github](https://github.com/contentful?q=boilerplate&type=all&language=&sort=) 
and add the required credentials to the project.

#### 5. Run the app based on your environment

No shortcut, the user is encouraged to run and hack the boilerplate he just downloaded.
